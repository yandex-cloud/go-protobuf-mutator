### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in mutator
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects mutator

## Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by mutator maintainers within 5 working days.
We will keep the reporter informed about the issue progress.

## Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by mutator maintainers and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a mitigation is available for mutator users. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to 90 days. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.
